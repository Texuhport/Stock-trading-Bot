### Calculated actual returns (pct change in Close Price) and used them to generate a signal column value
1.0 for buy -1.0 for sell and 0 for hold

The dataset had way more buy signals than sell signals

### Train a ML Model on deriving the Signal Value from the previous day's close value
Troubles increasing the accuracy of the model past 0.57


### Training a second Model and comparing outcomes

The SVC model was more accurate than the ADA model on average and took less time to run
